    <h2>7 reasons you should start a blog now</h2>
    <p>share their personal opinions on different topics and reach millions of like-minded people.</p>
    <p>We at TechJuice, are a staunch believer that everybody should blog on the internet, especially if you are in high school, college or university. This is the perfect time to involve yourself in extra activities and give yourself a head start at an early age.</p>
    <p>Not convinced? I will give you 7 reasons to start blogging.</p>

    <h3>1. You will become better writer</h3>
    <p>
    Everyone should strive to become a good writer. Because being a good writer is just not about writing only. A good writer has a very fine thought process and a good self-expression too. A good writer knows how to explain thoughts in a concise and coherent way. This attribute will help you a lot in your personal and professional career. The sooner you learn it, the better it is.</p>
    <p>By starting a blog, you will challenge yourself to write more often and share with others, which will improve your writing. The readers of your blog will also be leaving comments and critique which will encourage you to continue writing and excel in it.
    Your writing speaks volume about your personality. By becoming a good writer, you will have a better chance to move up the career ladder swiftly.
    </p>

    <h3>2. You will become a better reader</h3>
    <p>
    Reading and writing go hand in hand. If you want to become a good writer, read as much as possible. Reading improves vocabulary, enhances knowledge and lets you absorb different technicalities of written expression.</p>
    <p>There is a fair chance that if you read a lot, you are very good at writing too. Reading is the easiest way of self-improvement. But pick your reading list wisely. It is said, ‘You are the average of 5 friends you spend most of your time with.’ Books are friends too. If you will indulge in bad books, it will be expressed through your personality, thoughts, and, most importantly, your writing.</p>
    <p>When you start blogging, you will be constantly reading stuff here and there to get ideas for your next piece. Reading more will increase your pace and you will get to know how can you read more without compromising on the knowledge being imparted.

    <h3>3. You will become more confident</h3>
    <p>Speaking from personal experience, writing makes you more confident, especially if your writing is being read by a lot of people. You might be thinking, how? Well, if you are writing commercially, the content will generate a lot of discussion online as well as offline. People would approach you, they would want to speak to you. It is not unusual that based on your writings, you will be invited to speak at different events.</p>
    <p>Hence, blogging will not only improve your writing and reading, it will make you more confident and will shape up your personality.

    <h3>4. You will become brand</h3>
    <p>
    As I said earlier, if people are reading you, there are fair chances that they respect you, listen to you, and share your content in their social circles. It is great for personal brand development and there is no harm in getting slight fame for the good work you are doing.</p>
    <p>For brand development, I will suggest writing around a certain topic. Pick a topic and try to become an expert in that. Somebody rightly said, “If you are good at everything, you are good at nothing.” So pick a niche and start writing on it. Generally, people know what they are passionate about. If you pick that passion, I am sure, you will not have a hard time coming up with meaningful content around it.</p>

    <h3>5. You will make new friends</h3>
    <p>
    Through blogging you will develop new relationships with people. You will have new friends from all over the world. I, personally, have made so many new friends after I started writing. Some of the friends are from US, India, Thailand, Bangladesh etc. The friends I have made on the internet are genuine, always ready to help and sharing feedback on what we are doing at TechJuice.</p>
    <p>It is important to invest in family and friends in life. It is even more important to surround yourself with people, who care for you, who want you to succeed and who will be there for you in good and bad times. So, blogging is one sure shot easy way to make like-minded people your friends.
    </p>

    <h3>6. You will have a source of income</h3>
    <p>
    Blogging is a good way to generate money. If you are still in student life, blogging can be a great way to bear expenses. The sooner you become financially independent in life, the better it is for you. Money is a great tool, it is a lever, that can be utilized to make life better.</p>

    <p>There are thousands of bloggers in Pakistan and all over the world who are doing it full time professionally and making a very lucrative income out of it. If you are looking for some inspiration, read about Arianna Huffington and The Huffington Post.</p>

    <p>It is not bad to have money as the motivation behind blogging. But keep in mind that blogging requires passion. The results will surely come and you will be happy with them but you will have to wait as it is a slow process.

    <h3>7. It will make you more tech savvy</h3>
    <p>
    In 2016, when every company is trying to be a technology company, blogging will make you tech savvy. Buying a domain, hosting it, and then incorporating different tools to increase your user base will not only increase your technical knowledge but sometimes you will be getting your hands dirty with coding. And trust me, it is all good for you.</p>

    <p>Never shy away from solving your own problems. It will improve your technical skills and you can utilize this to help other bloggers or newbies in the field.</p>

    <p>If the above reasons are enough to make up your mind and you’re interested in technology and startups, you can either start working with TechJuice as a writer or, if your calling is some other niche like food, fashion, photography or anything else, I will encourage you to start your very own blog.
